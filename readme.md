# Node.js API Exercise
In this exercise, we would like you to create an API endpoint using node.js with the sales data in the two csv files provided.
Your API will need to extract information from both files and create one single endpoint with unified data. 

The endpoint should return the following information;
- City
- State
- Price
- Sales Date
- Latitude 
- Longitude 

Do not change the csv files manually.
You are free to structure the app however you like.

### Deliverables
- Working API endpoint that can be ran locally.
- A readme file that documents your approach and how to run the app.
- Zip file of your code and the readme file (Please remove node_modules folder if any are used). 

### Deadline
Please return the exercise to Billy by end of play Thursday 27th July.
